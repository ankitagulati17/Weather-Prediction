# Weather-Prediction
The Weather Type Prediction project uses various machine learning classifiers to predict weather conditions based on historical meteorological data. The goal is to compare the performance of popular algorithms such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
